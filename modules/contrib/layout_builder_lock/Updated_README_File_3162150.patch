+INTRODUCTION
+============
+
+Layout Builder Lock module allows to manage lock settings on sections of a
+layout by users. So, they can't perform certain actions when applied on an
+individual configure section.
+
+Lock settings:
+
+* Toggle all
+* Do not allow updating default blocks
+* Do not allow deleting default blocks
+* Do not allow moving default blocks
+* Do not allow adding new blocks
+* Do not allow configuring the section
+* Do not allow adding a new section before this section
+* Do not allow adding a new section after this section
+* Do not allow moving blocks into this section
+
+New blocks, when allowing to add them, will be placed under any default blocks.
+Users will be able to update, move and delete these blocks. Blocks from other
+sections can be moved into this section then, so the 'Move blocks from other
+sections into this section' lock setting will not apply anymore.
+
+As soon as one lock setting is enabled, a user won't be able to
+delete the section either.
