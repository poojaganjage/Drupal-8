## About

Simple live css is a D8 rewrite of https://www.drupal.org/project/live_css, but with basic features only.

CSS can be added within the page, with live preview. The changes can then be saved to a CSS file that will be added to every non-admin page. Its primary usage purpose is (temporarily) overriding existing css.
